      summary: Create Products <=> Main Image Relationships
      description: |-
        Here you can add a `Main Image` to a product. The `Main Image` will be a file and that file will be shown as the first image for the product it is related to.

        It's worth noting that you can only have 1 main image so unlike other relationships, you will be passing an object instead of an array in the body.

        In the Object, the type will be `main_image` and the ID will be the ID of the file you wish to make the main image for that product.
